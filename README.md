# E-Commerce Database Assignment

Welcome to the *E-Commerce Database Assignment* repository! This project is a comprehensive implementation of a relational database for an e-commerce platform. It includes detailed SQL scripts for creating and populating tables, as well as an ERD diagram for visualizing the database structure.

## üìö Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational database for an e-commerce platform. The database is designed to handle various aspects of an online store, including:

- *Products*: Information about items available for sale.
- *Brands*: Details about product manufacturers.
- *Categories*: Classification of products into categories.
- *Attributes*: Custom attributes like material, size, and technical specifications.
- *Variations*: Product variations such as color and size.
- *Inventory*: Stock management for individual product items.
- *Images*: URLs for product images.

The database is implemented in *MySQL* and adheres to best practices for normalization and referential integrity.

## üõ† Features

- *Entity-Relationship Diagram*: A visual representation of the database schema ([E-Commerce ERD Diagram.drawio](E-Commerce%20ERD%20Diagram.drawio)).
- *SQL Scripts*: Modular SQL scripts for creating and populating tables.
- *Data Integrity*: Use of foreign keys to enforce relationships between tables.
- *Sample Data*: Pre-populated tables with sample data for testing and demonstration.
- *Scalability*: Designed to handle large datasets and complex queries efficiently.
